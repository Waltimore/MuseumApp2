## Week 2 day 1

Worked on loading in the JSON data via a decoder. Uploaded swift files for all the different "structs" in the data obtained from the API. 
Also worked on setting up the Firebase database, Registration function basics work but signing in signing out is still buggy.

## Week 2 day 2

Made the functions to prepare data obtained via the API and send it to the next view controller. 
Changed my swift files to obtain/save different and extra data which is more convenient than the previous structs.
Created a function which allows users to search through the collection.
Attempted to make the segue between the search results and detail view controllers work properly.

Issues that need to be fixed: 
Not all artworks have labels, so different data needs to be obtained so details can be shown for all artworks.
Need to figure out how to make sure all data is retrieved before other lines of code are executed.

## Week 2 day 3

Changed the data that is requested and it now properly appears in the detail view controller.
"Add to collection" button works, saving the artwork to the user collection in Firebase.
Still have to work on creating some sort of dispatch queue to make sure code is executed in correct order so the data is properly transfered from 1 view controller to another.

Signing out still doesn't work properly.

## Week 2 day 4 & 5

User collections are now properly saved to Firebase using the user e-mail, data is obtained in your collection table view.
Changed the lay-out and order of view controllers. Worked on displaying other user collections but since logging in and out is still buggy it's hard to test. 

Changed structs so it's easier to get and save data in Firebase without getting errors constantly.

## Week 3 day 1 & 2

Forgot to push yesterday.

Changed the interface.

Fixed most issues which led to empty table views because the json data wasn't finished loading yet by using DispatchQueue. Also fixed the logging in/signing out issues by adding a listener checking for authentication status.

Looking up other users now properly works and being able to save collections made by other users also works, only thing left there is to properly create the table view that displays these which is then connected to the rest of the app.

Cleaned up part of the "Search" part of the code by combining some view controllers which were only doing slightly different things.

## Week 3 day 3

Tried fixing the structure of my repository and files but ended up completely messing everything up, then spent most of today trying to fix that. 
Most of the files are now in appropriate folders.

Tableview that displays liked users now correctly displays these and properly communicates with Firebase.

## Week 3 day 4 & 5

Added a way to give a name to your collections and changed the Firebase data structure because of it. Added new segue's to allow users to choose which collection to add to.
added some pictures that can be used for the interface. Fixed a lot of bugs with displaying data in the table views.

## Week 4 day 1

Fixed issues that lead to the app crashing in certain circumstances and made the interface more intuitive.

## Week 4 day 2 

Made the cells prettier and worked on adding images of artWorks to more view controllers to make the whole app more "pretty" and cool to use, but because of the json data which stores the URL for the image in different places everytime (or sometimes there simply is none) this was harder than expected and lead to me breaking a few things. Now decided to work with a "No image available" picture in the problem cases which fixed most issues.
